This is just a variety of data analytics/data science themed projects I've done, mostly just to learn different ML algorithms and their applications so don't expect! Some are random (in the random folder) but some have commentary alongside (any in the root folder, for example classify-lifters.ipynb).

This project uses data from the [OpenPowerlifting dataset](https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/),
which is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

The dataset is not redistributed in this repository — only referenced for educational use.
